In  Task 2 of IELTS Writing, Qualifying words are the words in the question which tell the student how the various ideas relate together.
They are often the words that present opinion.

> Technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in the world today. In the not
> too distant future, technology will completely replace the teacher in the
> classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Here, we see the phrase ‘increasingly prevalent’. What does this tell us about
technology? We also see ‘completely replace’. What does ‘completely replace’
tell us about the relationship between technology and the classroom? How are
these qualifying words shaping the question?
