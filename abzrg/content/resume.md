## Tools I Use

- __Version Control__: Git
- __Build Systems__: Make, CMake (build system generator)
- __Debugging__: `gdb`, `lldb`, `valgrind`, clang sanitizers, `clangd`, `clang-tidy`, `clang-format`, `bear`, `ctags`
- __Coreutils__: `find`, `sed`, `awk`, `xargs`, ...
- __Editors__: (Neo)vim, ed, GNU Emacs
- __Misc.__:
  - **tmux**: All my development work occurs in various tmux sessions. I can smoothly switch between projects using a custom shell script and a customized tmux shortcut.
  - **ssh**: When I'm in a different room or away from my main Linux computer, I SSH into it to continue my work on a different machine. Additionally, I use Anydesk's _TCP tunneling_ feature to SSH into the university laboratory computer, avoiding distractions from other users. Furthermore, I use SSH key pairs for remote interactions with repositories on GitHub and GitLab. These key pairs can also be used for signing documents or commits if needed.
  - **regular expression / regex**: I use regex daily to search for specific string patterns in code using `grep` (or `git grep --cached`). I've also employed regex in projects like [pronunciation.sh](https://gist.github.com/abzrg/b91940c43a54915176b13822eb067161) and [citle](https://github.com/abzrg/citle) to extract specific URL patterns from HTML content.
  - __DOCKER__ I utilized Docker to learn x86 assembly (Nasm) on my arm64 Mac. Additionally, I created an [OpenFOAM-3 image](https://gist.github.com/abzrg/33d9173c872fb34efa055326859b0c5b) for use on a Ubuntu-20.4 machine (as direct installation on the host was not feasible).

## Open Source Contributions

- [A collection of programming exercises to help you practice your new language](https://github.com/jadijadi/Practical-Programming-Practices)
  - I contribute to the repository by providing C solutions for problems.

- [Formatted C++20 stdlib man pages (cppreference)](https://github.com/jeaye/stdman)
  - I contribute by updating man-pages when new HTML versions are available from an unofficial repository (verified by cppreference.com).
